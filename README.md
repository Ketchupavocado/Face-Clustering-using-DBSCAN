My code runs off of a facial recognition and detection model called Face Clustering using DBSCAN. The changes I made was, GPU and USB camera compatibility, live streaming, detecting within a min/max range, easy fps changer, bounding boxes that smoothly track with faces, and automatic screenshots and learning of unknown faces within 2 runs of the script, not only is it very simple but is easy to use and change to fit your name and face.

# Face Clustering Algorithm

This code shows face clustering using [DBSCAN](
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html) (Density Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise) algorithm.
